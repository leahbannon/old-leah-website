Clay Shirky’s [*Here Comes Everybody*][1] was a relief from the social media books and articles that I [have][2] [read][3] [ recently][4], many of which trend toward the cutesy with oversimplified explanations and invented or appropriated terminology. This is not to say that they are all necessarily bad; I&#8217;m just sick of them. : )

Shirky contributes (well, contributed in 2008 &#8211; I may be a little late to the party) an excellent book that explains and analyzes trends in social media through discussions of theories of social science and economics, which is a fresh and intelligent approach.

As with most writing about social media, Shirky’s central tenet is to explain the new control of the online masses over professions and information that were formerly the purview of an elite few. In *Here Comes Everybody*, however, I found two recurring themes especially interesting: effectiveness without efficiency and mass amateurization.

Shirky discusses theories of business about management and efficiency, including that of [Ronald Coase][5]. Coase argued (and this is a very short and dirty summary) that as companies get larger, they need levels of management, HR, etc. to maintain efficiency, however this makes everything they do slightly more expensive. This, in turn, means that some large and very important tasks will never be accomplished if they are too expensive for large companies to take on and cannot be accomplished by small companies.

Shirky argues the internet changed all this, enabling massive tasks to be accomplished with little management and organization. As Shirky states, “New tools allow large groups to collaborate, by taking advantage of nonfinancial motivations and by allowing for wildly differing levels of contribution.” Projects can be inefficient, but still highly effective.

Wikipedia is an obvious example of this. It requires many eyes to continue to be accurate, and it is never really finished, but always being tweaked, edited, and improved. However, it’s effectiveness and value is incalculable.

In mass amateurization, Shirky discusses the common theme of formerly elite professions being taken over by the masses. Journalism is the most popular example here, where people are not only obtaining more and more of their information from their friends and connections online, but also providing information more immediately than news media at times, as in the London bombings. Mass amateurization is also very valuable, because, as Shirky states, it “is a result of the radical spread of expressive capabilities&#8230;”

I take an important lesson away from *Here Comes Everybody* when considering social media for some of my pro bono clients. My current approach has been to try to be the gatekeeper for social media, worrying that we will look unprofessional and amateurish if interns make common social media gaffes. For example, new Twitterers frequently love the hashtag, but rarely use it correctly.

I cannot be a perfectionist with social media, however, and I certainly can&#8217;t commit the time that would require. I think that some careful strategy planning on my part and then loosening of the reigns may be a better approach. I don’t want to make the common and tempting mistakes of [ Nupedia][6].

Contributors will make mistakes, some possibly embarrassing. However, the result of greater collaboration from more contributors may provide a better result.
