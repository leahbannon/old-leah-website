For my current digital media communications course, I have the task of reviewing the small book [*Tribes*][1] by [Seth Godin][2]. I would like to begin by suggesting you watch this unrelated recent video of Mr. Godin from a [Gel conference][3] (sort of like [TED][4], I guess):



In this video (that I hope you just enjoyed), Godin starts with a directly pertinent (and funny) opening story, and then launches into his speech in which he:

1. Suggests a thesis idea.  
2. Explains and supports that idea with its seven component ideas.  
3. Uses many funny, but more importantly, completely pertinent pictures to support those component ideas.  
4. Arrives at a final conclusion.

If you have read *Tribes*, does this sound familiar? No. To me, it is completely different. Like night and day. If you have not read *Tribes*, I do not recommend it. You can instead watch this TED video that outlines Godin&#8217;s ideas about tribes, which is funny, free, and very short (albeit still difficult to follow and a bit frenetic, much like the book, and full of many not-quite-related pictures, unlike the book):



Now that you&#8217;re fully versed in Godin, onto the review: In *Tribes* (the book), Godin argues that the old system of top-down management isn’t very good because it stifles innovation and improvements, and (this part is addressed more in the speech) because it is increasingly less profitable or successful these days. However, you (yes, you!) can be a leader, not just a manager, by finding your tribe and stepping forward to lead it.

More specifically, you need to find a group that shares your interest and lead them by challenging the status quo, developing a culture, and then committing (to each other, your tribe, and the cause).

What is a tribe? Godin describes it as a group that is connected to each other, an idea, and a leader. You can’t lead without a tribe and a tribe can’t exist without a leader. Otherwise, you’re just a manager telling people what to do in the same way every day or they are just a random group not really accomplishing anything (anything new or groundbreaking, anyway).

Additionally, Godin argues that we are in a new era where the web and social media make it far easier for tribes to find each other and assemble. And (more importantly, perhaps) for you to find your tribe and become its leader.

These are intriguing ideas. However, much like in his TED video about tribes (above), Godin is somewhat unclear because his delivery is messy and non-linear. Godin provides many short (very, very short) chapters that are not really connected to the previous chapter or following chapter. They include random ideas or stories that generally support the main points that I outlined above, but don’t build to understandable, actionable arguments.

Often, Godin’s stories are helpful real world examples. However, all too frequently they are silly fictions that are meant to support an argument but merely exhaust it. I found a story about a unicorn that disrupts a balloon factory where people liked things quiet, calm, and soft and hated change or sharp points especially unnecessary and corny.

Additionally, Godin is constantly reminding the reader, with great urgency, that this directly affects them and that they should act immediately, with comments like, “The market needs you (*we* need you) and the tools are there, just waiting. All that’s missing is you, and your vision and your passion.” These kinds of statements are constantly repeated and become a bit exhausting: the urgency begins to feel trite after it is worn out in every chapter.

Godin is a talented, funny speaker. He has some even better ideas. I hope his future presentations and books are more like his Gel talk and less like *Tribes*.
