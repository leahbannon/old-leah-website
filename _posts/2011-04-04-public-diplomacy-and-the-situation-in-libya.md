I&#8217;m in a Public Diplomacy class at Hopkins this semester. Here is my presentation, theoretically as a diplomat who needs to present the issue to a group of foreign nationals. I am explaining how the events transpired and our 2 key reasons for action.

(Update: This would be a back up tool to a presentation, not a stand-alone document. The key in this is to demonstrate how the events unfolded in such a unique way that they led the US to get involved, as President Obama argued. Also, it&#8217;s meant to be a presentation, so it reads/looks better in full screen mode.)
