I recently gave my mother, who is working to build her own web design company (woo!), some quick social media advice. She creates websites and Facebook pages for clients, but doesn’t manage online communications and engagement (yet).

She asked me, “What should I tell someone, like a realtor, if they are curious about ‘getting into’ social media?” What are some quick and easy pieces of advice? It’s so basic that it felt like a good exercise to me. Some thoughts:

*   Don’t expect social media to be an “if we build it, they will come” opportunity. It’s really just a way to reach more people, as long as you put the same amount of work into it that you would put into developing in-person connections. You’re still trying to connect with people, not robots &#8211; social media just extends your reach.
*   Consider what you’re looking for when you want to hire someone. You would probably start searching for basic information and references. So start simple, and build a presence on a page where your past clients can provide reviews, like Facebook and Yelp.
*   On a related note: you need to be ready for your client’s opinion of your service to be (seen as) the truth. Are you comfortable with that?
*   After that, if you want to do more and can commit more time, focus on showcasing your success and expertise. If you’re a realtor, share advice about home ownership/improvement and selling. Post pictures of successful sales.
