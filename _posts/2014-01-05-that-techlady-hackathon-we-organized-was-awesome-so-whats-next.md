*Update! The next TechLady Hackathon + Training Day will be on July 26, 2014. More details coming soon! [Sign up for the newsletter.](http://leah.io/newsletter)*

On December 7, I organized a hackathon for women with significant help from [Kat Townsend][1], [Jen Higgins][2], [Shannon Turner][3], [Sarah Rigdon][4], [Rebecca Williams][5], [Shauna Dillavou][6], [Ousmane Mariko][7] (who designed our logo), and Code for DC brigade captains [Matt Bailey][8] and [Justin Grimes][9].

TLDR: It went better than we could have hoped, over 100 women attended, and you can learn more about it in [the summary wrap-up blog post on the new Code for DC blog][10], the [Storify][11] coverage of the best social media from the event, or the organization website at [techladyhackathon.org][12]. There will be more, so sign up for [my monthly newsletter][13].

### Instead of summarizing again, I&#8217;d like to add a few interesting thoughts:

First, almost half of the women checked a box while registering to indicate that they wanted to volunteer to help. (!!!) In organizing this, I had incredible help and advice from almost everyone I asked, especially a lot of awesome, busy women. So awesome.

I kept expecting to hear about problems or complaints about the overfull classes, but nobody complained. A few days before the hackathon, we lost several of our instructors. The day of the event, the hackpad that we used for people to sign up for the over-full courses crashed. As problems arose, we just rolled with them. Women jumped in to help or just made it work.

I kept hearing again and again about how much more comfortable women felt in the classes participating and asking questions. I thought and hoped that might happen, so it meant a lot to me that it worked.

That last point is incredibly important to me. My first inspiration to organize the hackathon came from a python class that Shannon Turner gave in Jen Higgins’s living room back in September to me and three other women. I felt comfortable asking questions in the class when I was lost and when I noticed something interesting. The other women asked interesting questions that helped me, too. At one point I looked around and realized I was just incredibly happy to be learning tech with a lot of supportive, smart women. I wanted to recreate that for more women.

### A few things to change next time

*   More class options: The main goal of most of the training this time was to just offer incredibly basic introductions to what the code is used for and some of terminology. There are a lot of reasons for this, which I will save for another blog. But next time, I want to offer some classes that let women get their hands dirty.
*   More hacking: I want to encourage more free-floating between classes and hacking. One way that I had planned to do this (but didn&#8217;t) was to post signs on the tables where hackers were working to briefly explain what they were working on and the skills they could use. I hope that makes it easier to approach a table next time. I am also considering how to re-work the schedule to make it easier to check out a hackathon project without missing training. Hmm&#8230;
*   Child care: This is a tough one for a lot of different legal and logistical reasons, but I want to offer some kind of childcare next time.
*   There is more, but those are the big ones this time. Post your feedback in the comments below or [on this form][14]. Include not just feedback if you attended, but what you&#8217;d like to see next time, whether or not you attended.

### What&#8217;s next??

I&#8217;m tentatively planning the next one for June. Want to get the updates? Sign up for [my monthly newsletter][13] about awesome tech training, women in tech opportunities, and DC tech events. And go to [the next Code for DC meetup][15]!! It&#8217;s one of the best ways to learn and meet more awesome tech people.
