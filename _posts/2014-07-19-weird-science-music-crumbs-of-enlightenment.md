### Hi there.

How's your July? I got back from [<u>YXYY</u>](https://vine.co/v/MxJIXdBJl7L)&nbsp;and went to [Camera Obscura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3CkfvYMCWM) at the 9:30 Club last night and it was awesome (thanks Rebecca). TONIGHT I'm going to this **cool nerd party/fundraiser**: [Weird Science House Party](http://weirdscience.splashthat.com/) (discount code:&nbsp;friendsofcomRED). Let me know if you want to grab dinner first.

The Tech Lady Hackathon is next Saturday, July 26! I'll send around a schedule and what to expect&nbsp;soon.&nbsp;We sold out (over 200 tickets) in a day!&nbsp;:-0 If you missed registration,&nbsp;the [MapBox Friday pre-party](http://techladyjuly.splashthat.com/) is still open. Also, hang in there:&nbsp;there will be more in October and December.

### What else is going on?

My friends Lesbians Who Tech were in the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/fashion/silicon-valley-embrace-gay-and-lesbian-community.html?_r=1). I'm excited. Did I mention they're having a [brunch](http://lesbianswhotech.org/events/event/lesbians-who-tech-washington-dc-july-brunch/)? Bread for the City [wrote about a Code for DC](http://www.breadforthecity.org/2014/07/streamlining-the-affordable-housing-application-process/) project to simplify and streamline affordable housing applications. [Shut That Down](http://shutthatdown.com/) has an awesome new redesign.&nbsp;I'm tired of feigning appreciation for crumbs of [enlightened feminist thinking](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118735/problem-esquires-praise-42-year-old-women-amy-poehler). Lauren found the&nbsp;[erotica stash at the&nbsp;Library of Congress](http://wamu.org/programs/metro_connection/14/07/18/the_delta_collection_sneaking_a_peek_at_the_library_of_congress_erotica_stash)&nbsp;for WAMU.&nbsp;Eric showed me this cool color puzzle game and I love it: [Blendoku](http://www.blendoku.com/).

I'm a fan of Hacker School's social rules, one of which no [Subtle -isms](https://www.hackerschool.com/blog/38-subtle-isms-at-hacker-school). I am researching office culture, so if you have anything good on this, I'd love to see it (just reply to this). [Here](http://alistapart.com/article/living-up-to-your-business-ideals) [are](http://blog.percolate.com/2014/04/onboarding-at-percolate/) [some](http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/leadership-management/what-great-bosses-know/258040/6-dangerous-biases-of-bosses/) [more](http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm) articles. [Model View Culture](http://modelviewculture.com/) is also an awesome resource.
