  I usually try to defend the latest Facebook change since I accept that they are a business providing a free tool and not a free public service, but this is nuts! Today’s changes, which are forcing users to share most of the information in their Info tab, aka basic info, aka bio description, with Everyone or delete it entirely, are pretty difficult to defend. (Capitalized terms are Facebook terminology.)

  <strong>So what changed?</strong>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Basically, Facebook seems to have decided that they want you to be linked to everyone else who has listed the same information about their personal history and interests. Because Facebook also decided that everything you are a fan of is public information (or really anything you link to in your profile, now), you are now being forced to share all of this information with Everyone (or delete it from your profile). This includes information under Likes and Interests (Activities, Movies, Music, Books, etc.) and Work and Education (colleges, majors and concentrations, high school, employer’s city, the length of employment, etc.).

  So, when you next log in, you will be prompted to “link” all of your information, and thereby share it with Everyone – and then you have to decide for yourself what you want to share with Everyone and what you want to share with no one.

  However, this is frustratingly inconsistent. What I still can’t figure out is why my favorite quotation, which is only shared with My Friends and not linked to anything, can be viewed by anyone and everyone. Also, users still have options to supposedly restrict this information in their Privacy Settings, but this won&#8217;t actually do anything but give you a false sense of security because it&#8217;s all being shared anyway!

  <strong>Your Business Model?</strong>

  What I find most bizarre about this is that Facebook believes that the main reason they succeeded where MySpace failed is because Facebook users were posting a lot of real, personal information about themselves to share with their friends, whereas on MySpace they were putting up facades and sharing little. These new changes will only encourage Facebook users to take down much of their information and stop sharing.
