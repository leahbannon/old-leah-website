It’s been almost exactly a year since I finished grad school and almost as long since I last posted on this blog. Eek. After a few months of recovery, I decided I wasn’t learning nearly enough tech on my own or at work (I manage a small fed gov’s website, social media, digital strategy, etc.). I started attending some of DC’s tech meetups, which I really love. I’ve learned a lot and met a lot of very cool people. And, I started applying some of that at work and was named open gov lead at my agency.

**Some of those tech meetups:**

*   [Code for DC][1]
*   [DC Web API User Group][2]
*   [Tech LadyMafia][3]
*   [Data Science DC][4]

**More about Code for DC**

Join us!! You are welcome. As [Ben Balter blogged about recently][5], open source/civic coding projects need all kinds of skill sets, not just developers. At Code for DC, we’d really love to have some graphic designers, branding experts (we are not great at naming our projects, etc.), and project manager types. And you get to learn tech and improve DC.

Recently, I’ve been working on an ANC project over at [ancbrigade.com][6]. Right now, you can learn more about DC’s most local form of government and find your ANC commissioner and single member district. Our goal is to help DC residents learn more about the decisions that their ANC is making for their neighborhoods and simplify getting involved. Our next step is to start ingesting and tagging meeting info and minutes.

I have also been working on [DC Community Resource Data][7], which is organizing/cataloging/tagging DC&#8217;s social services and social welfare organizations. The goal of the project is to build a sustainable and well tagged data layer that we can use to build search tools and apps that help improve access to the services.

**A few other things**

A few other groups/list serves/sites that I’ve been enjoying lately are: [Github][8], [Tumblr][9], [Pinterest][10], [the Sunlight Labs open gov list serve][11], [US Government APIs list serve][12], [Code Academy][13], [remote Mexican beach Vines][14], and [Preamp.fm][15].
