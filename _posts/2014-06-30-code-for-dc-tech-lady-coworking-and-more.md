### Hi there.

We're trying something new over at Code for DC, and I'm excited about it. Once a month, we're co-hosting a Tech Lady Coworking night with our good friends over at&nbsp;[Hear Me Code](http://hearmecode.com)&nbsp;at TOMORROW!&nbsp;Come by for coworking, study group, or to learn some new tech from 6-9pm.&nbsp;[RSVP&nbsp;here!](http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-DC/events/192271622/)

Welcome to some new ladies from DCFemTech. This is a short and quick version - I'll send out more soon.
