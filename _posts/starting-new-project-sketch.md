1. Start with a community organization that's working on a cause you believe in. Find someone who works there and who you can work with.
1. Find a problem that needs a technical solution.
1. Find a time you can meet to do a user-centered design sketch. Do basic 3-hour user-centered design session (probably at a brigade meetup) that includes community partners and users. (Work with community partner to get important attendees there). [guidelines for conducting that design session coming soon]
1. Develop *prioritized* list of user stories that will get you to a basic, initial prototype of the design you developed in the session above. This list is called the "backlog." Make it a super basic minimum viable product! (So basic that it just needs to be the absolute minimum example that users can test. You might want to start with a paper prototype.)
1. Choose how many of the user stories your team can accomplish in a month. This is called a "sprint." (Sprints are usually shorter, but a month is probably the right period of time for volunteer groups.) You might want to kick the sprint off with a hackathon.
1. Once you've finished an MVP, work with community partner to set up a round of ux testing. Add any necessary changes based on ux testing to the backlog as user stories.
1. Repeat last 2 steps til you have a slightly more refined MVP. Demo to your brigade (so we can cheer for your work). Invite community partners and any other stakeholders (possibly in government).
1. Repeat last 2 steps as needed until you no longer can no longer OR no longer need to sustain the product.
