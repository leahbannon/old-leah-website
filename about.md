## About Me

I am a product lead at [18F](http://18f.gsa.gov), a new digital services startup within the federal government.

I spend a lot of my free time as one of three co-captains of [Code for DC](http://codefordc.org), especially organizing the [TechLady Hackathon + Training Days](http://techladyhackathon.org).

I have a master's from Johns Hopkins University and a bachelor's from the George Washington University.

I was born right here in DC, but I spent most of grade school in Dallas. I prefer DC.
