## DC Bars sans TV


This is a map of DC bars and restaurants that don't have televisions (or the TV is at least very easy to ignore). I find it difficult to think or listen to my friends when a TV is on in the background, and I think friends and thinking are much more important than TV. I know I'm missing quite a few fine establishments... [check out the GitHub repo and its readme to learn how to contribute](https://github.com/leahbannon/dc-bars-sans-tv)!
