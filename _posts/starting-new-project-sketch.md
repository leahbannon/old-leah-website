1. Start with a community project that's working on a cause you believe in. Find someone who works there and who you can work with.
1. Find a project that needs a technical solution.
1. Find a time you can meet to do a user-centered design sketch. Do basic 3-hour user-centered design session (probably at a brigade meetup) that includes community partners and users. (Work with community partner to get important attendees there). [guidelines for conducting that design session coming soon]
1. Develop prioritized list of user stories that will get you to a basic, initial prototype of what you designed in session (above). This list is called the "backlog." Make it a super basic minimum viable product! (So basic that it just needs to be the absolute minimum required to build something that users can test.)
1. Choose how many of the user stories your team can accomplish in a month. This is called a "sprint." (Sprints are usually shorter, but a month is probably the right period of time for volunteer groups.)
1. Once you've finished an MVP, work with community partner to set up a round of ux testing. Add any changes you find you need to make based on that testing to the backlog.
1. Repeat last 3 steps. Demo to brigade (so we can cheer for your work). Invite community partners and any other stakeholders (possibly in government).
1. Repeat last 4 steps as needed until you no longer can no longer/no longer need to sustain the product.
