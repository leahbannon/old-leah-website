I just discovered Google Reader Bundles, and it&#8217;s very cool. Google Reader provides suggested blogs under an incredible number of different subjects &#8211; 449 to be exact. I had a lot of fun with it. You can see some of the Bundles I added on the left.

p.s. If you&#8217;re looking for blogs about smoothies, the &#8220;Blender&#8221; subject is not that. : )
