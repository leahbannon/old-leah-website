To begin, I must say that I am starting to get a little tired of [*Groundswell: Winning in a World Transformed by Social Technologies*][1] (this is the third time I have had to read it for a class) mostly because, as the years go by, the book’s stories are losing their shock value. The brave new world that the authors describe has really been the norm for many years now.

That being said, I do recognize that many of the lessons are still very important in social media and marketing today, and the stories can still be very helpful in explaining social media concepts to the unfamiliar. Also, I haven&#8217;t written anything yet for you, dear readers, so enjoy:

**About Groundswell**  
Basically, the phenomenon that the authors refer to as, “the groundswell,” is a “social media trend in which people use technologies to get the things they need from each other, rather than from traditional institutions like corporations.” As I said above, this isn’t really a trend anymore so much as the norm, but I still take their point.

The authors argue that this is happening now because of three key factors: people, technology, and economics. People are getting their information from “people like me,” now, who they trust far more than any authority figure or news source now. This is important &#8211; it is essentially the crux of any good argument for why you should pay me to help you market your product or improve your brand in social media.

The technology component is obvious &#8211; look at all [these][2] [great][3] [new][4] [tools][5]! Finally, economics, which is a somewhat less clear factor in their argument, is because of online advertising and measurable site traffic.

For more fun, you can calculate how your target audience might choose to interact with their “people like me,” online with this handy tool:



Note: A few things have changed since that tool was last updated. For example, older demographics are getting much more involved in social media. According to [a recent study by Pew Internet][6] (a project of the Pew Research Center), engagement in social networks in demographics aged 50 and older has nearly doubled over the past year.

**Relationships**  
According to Groundswell, “relationships are everything” now. People are interacting and developing relationships and communities online around your product, market, or brand. Most importantly, listen to what they are saying. I believe that this is an important point that people frequently miss &#8211; they want to jump in and engage right away and they miss that one of the most valuable ways they can use the groundswell is to learn what is being said.

**How to Engage**  
The authors suggest a method they call “POST” for brands looking to engage online with their customers:  
-People: Learn about your customers, their online habits, and how they prefer to engage online.  
-Objectives: Define your goals. Are you marketing? Training? Developing a new way to collaborate?  
-Strategy: What do you want from you customers? Do you want them to be advocates for your brand or product reviewers? How much control over the message should they have?  
-Technology: Note that this is last! Once you have figured out POS, this part is easy: blog, wiki, or social network?

I like this approach, but I think it is missing a little bit of L: Listening. I believe that you should know not just how your customers behave online, but everything that they said in the past and are discussing now everywhere &#8211; not just in the areas that you want to engage online. I believe that this is the safest and best way that you can learn how to engage, influence, and lead.

Looking for more? Looks like one of the authors, Josh Bernoff, has released a new book, [Empowered][7], as I am constantly reminded while trying to access the Groundswell tools.
