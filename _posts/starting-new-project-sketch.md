1. Start with a community organization and municipal partners that are working on a cause you believe in.
1. Work with them to find a problem that actually needs a technical solution.
1. Find a time you can meet to do a user-centered design sketch. Do basic 3-hour user-centered [design brainstorming session](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/engagement/#brainstorming-session) (probably at a brigade meetup) that includes community and municipal partners AND users to find a (possible) solution. (Work with community partner to get the right attendees there). [guidelines for conducting that design session and who should be there coming soon]
1. Develop *prioritized* list of user stories that will get you to a basic, initial prototype of the design you developed in the session above. This list is called the "backlog." Make it a super basic minimum viable product! (So basic that it just needs to be the absolute minimum example that users can test. You might want to start with a paper prototype.)
1. Work with the team to develop technical requirements for implementing user stories. Choose how many of the user stories your team can accomplish in a month. This is called a "sprint." (Sprints are usually shorter, but a month is probably the right period of time for volunteer groups.) You might want to kick the sprint off with a hackathon.
1. Once you've finished an MVP (getting there might take a few sprints), work with your community partner to set up a round of ux testing. Conduct ux testing.
1. Add any necessary changes based on ux testing to the backlog as user stories. Continue planning and doing sprints until you have a slightly more refined MVP.
1. Invite community partners and any other stakeholders (possibly in government) to your next brigade meetup and demo your MVP to everyone (so we can cheer for you). 
1. Repeat last 3 steps until you can't or won't continue to sustain the product.
