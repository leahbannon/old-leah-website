As a communications consultant who focuses on web engagement (and loves to play with every shiny new web tool that comes along), I have found that creating aha! moments for colleagues is incredibly valuable. This often happens when I connect my new web tool or strategy to something funny that people have seen or experienced in their life.

I am aware that I have not said anything groundbreaking here, but I&#8217;d like to start recording/sharing more of these. My final class at Hopkins is Digital Political Strategy with Alan Rosenblatt, and he has a lot of great aha! moments to share, so here is a great one in a presentation he gave that I&#8217;m watching tonight ([watch it here on C-SPAN: Here Comes Social Advocacy][1]):

> Now, I&#8217;ve heard a lot of people say that, &#8216;oh, Twitter is just&#8230; silly. It&#8217;s a bunch of people talking about what they had for breakfast, you can&#8217;t say anything meaningful in 140 characters. It&#8217;s just ridiculous.&#8217; Well&#8230; how many people have ever heard of a haiku? Ok, now I have gone through several books of haikus. And I have counted, counted characters and spaces. And, I have yet to find a haiku that has more than 80 characters. And I get 140 of them in a tweet! Now, you can describe the universe in a haiku, so don&#8217;t tell me you can&#8217;t say something meaningful in 140 characters.
