This is a little off topic, but I&#8217;d like to share an op-ed I wrote for class:

Shortly after I graduated from college, I purchased a small condo. I am constantly applauded for this decision, which required a mortgage more than double the size of my student loans. Friends, family, and tax advisers continue to tell me that this was a responsible, mature choice. My student loan debt, however, which costs much less per month, is stigmatized by society. I should do everything in my power to pay it off as quickly as possible, I should feel bad about it, I should wait to start grad school and take on more debt, etc.

On the contrary, I view my undergraduate education as imperative to beginning my career and graduate school as an investment and opportunity that is already helping me adjust and advance my career. Owning my condo, however, has held me back both financially and geographically. Why does our society view these debts so differently?

A mortgage is almost universally considered “good debt” by economists and financial experts. Mortgages are viewed as a wise investment in your home, your family, and your future. Student loan debt, however, is more debatable. Most experts advise that the debt is possibly “good” if it leads directly to a related job, and only up to a certain reasonable amount, not to exceed about $30-$50,000.

A “reasonable” limit of $30-$50,000 in total student loans will no longer support most Americans as tuition continues to rise. That amount does not even approach the average cost of tuition for four years at both private and state schools anymore. According to [a recent study by the College Board][1], the average cost of tuition for one year in-state at public schools is about $19,338 and $39,028 at private schools.

College may provide more important benefits than home ownership, however. A recent study by the College Board ([pdf here][2]) found that, for 2008, the median salary for full-time employees with a college degree was almost three times that of full-time employees with just a high school diploma. Additionally, a college degree provided far greater job security in 2009, even during the recession: the unemployment rate for college graduates was less than half of that of high school graduates.

Does home ownership provide this kind of class mobility and financial security? While home ownership is usually considered a sound investment because of the equity saved in the home, it is clearly no guarantee, as we have learned from the recent housing bubble. Additionally, even if the property maintains or grows in value, the costs of upkeep, interest, insurance, condo or HOA fees, and property taxes are still substantial &#8211; many of which do not end once a mortgage is paid off.

While the federal government does subsidize education through grants and student loans like Perkins and Stafford loans, the rates are still much higher than most mortgages, the loan amounts are not keeping up with the increasing cost of tuition, and only a small amount of the interest paid on a student loan is deductible, and only under certain conditions.

Tax payers can deduct the interest paid on a mortgage worth up to $1 million if filing jointly and there is absolutely no income limit on this. They can also deduct the interest paid on an additional $100,000 for investments in the home. A home owner with this kind of mortgage can deduct thousands of dollars per month for almost the entire life of the mortgage. Even the average homeowner deducted over $12,000 in 2008, according to [a study by the Tax Foundation][3].

However, tax payers can only deduct up to $2500 of student loan interest per year, an amount that is phased out when they start making an adjusted income of $60,000 per year and then completely unavailable when they make $75,000 per year or more ($120,000 and $150,000 if filing jointly).

I do not advocate eliminating mortgage interest deductions &#8211; they have been a part of our tax law for over 100 years and Americans expect and rely upon them today. I would instead argue that we reassess the kind of debt that we value and therefore subsidize, and the kind that we stigmatize.

We should create more reasonable limits for deductions, for example, by creating income limits and lowering mortgage limits for mortgage interest deductions and raising the limits on student loan interest deductions. Education is one of the best ways our society can gain class mobility and financial security. We should better support its costs.
