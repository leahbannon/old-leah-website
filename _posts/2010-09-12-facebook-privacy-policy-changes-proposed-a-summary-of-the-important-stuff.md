On Friday, Facebook posted a proposed new Privacy Policy for comments &#8211; Facebook now makes most changes available for comment before implementing them to mitigate anger and blowback once changes are enacted. There are 2 big changes you should be aware of – don’t panic though: you will be able to opt out of them and they don&#8217;t exist yet; this is just Facebook&#8217;s way of reserving the right to implement them later.

**1. Sharing Your Info With 3<sup>rd</sup> Parties**: Facebook will share some of your information with other “pre-approved” partner sites that you browse (while still logged in to Facebook) to create a more “personalized” experience. They haven’t said who these partner sites will be, but that the information shared will only be content you label as sharable with “Everyone” and that you will be able to opt out.

*Excerpt from [Privacy Policy][1] &#8220;Information You Share With Third Parties. Pre-Approved Third-Party Websites and Applications. In order to provide you with useful social experiences off of Facebook, we occasionally need to provide General Information about you to pre-approved third party websites and applications that use Platform at the time you visit them (if you are still logged in to Facebook). Similarly, when one of your friends visits a pre-approved website or application, it will receive General Information about you so you and your friend can be connected on that website as well (if you also have an account with that website). In these cases we require these websites and applications to go through an approval process, and to enter into separate agreements designed to protect your privacy. For example, these agreements include provisions relating to the access and deletion of your General Information, along with your ability to opt-out of the experience being offered. You can also remove any pre-approved website or application you have visited here, or block all pre-approved websites and applications from getting your General Information when you visit them here. In addition, if you log out of Facebook before visiting a pre-approved application or website, it will not be able to access your information. You can see a complete list of pre-approved websites on our About Platform page.”*

**2. Location Features:** In addition to sharing your current location (like you can in Twitter), Facebook says that they’ve “added the concept of a ‘place’ that could refer to a Page, such as one for a local restaurant.” This is confusing, but probably means that instead of just sharing your GPS coordinates, for example, they will also detect what place that location means, such as your home or a restaurant you are a fan of.

While this is all still pretty unclear, details about the location services are expected at Facebook’s upcoming f8 conference in April.

*Excerpt from **[Privacy Policy][1]** &#8220;Access Device and Browser Information. When you access Facebook from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit.&#8221;*

*Also, as quoted above under &#8220;Information You Share With Third Parties.&#8221; &#8220;We may also make information about the location of your computer or access device and your age available to applications and websites in order to help them implement appropriate security measures and control the distribution of age-appropriate content. If the application or website wants to access any other data, it will have to ask for your permission.*&#8221;
