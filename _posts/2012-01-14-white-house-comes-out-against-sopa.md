This week, the Obama administration [released a response][1] to [We the People petitions][2] about [SOPA][3].

I think it&#8217;s well written and I like that they address not just the potential outcomes of SOPA that have been raised most frequently, that SOPA will end the internet or kill innovation, but also that it could so easily help censor perfectly legal content. I think that would be the most likely outcome, not that I think it has a chance of actually passing.

> Any effort to combat online piracy must guard against the risk of online censorship of lawful activity and must not inhibit innovation by our dynamic businesses large and small.

Update: The more I&#8217;m reading, I see quite a few flaws in their response. As [Jeff Jarvis states][4] in describing [Tim O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s great response][5],

> Tim O&#8217;Reilly quite rightly challenges the White House to prove that piracy is a problem. I thought the same thing as I read the Administration&#8217;s SOPA skinback: It&#8217;s proving a negative. Who&#8217;s to say how much material would be bought if there were no pirates? Who&#8217;s to say how much more is bought because piracy spreads products and brands?
