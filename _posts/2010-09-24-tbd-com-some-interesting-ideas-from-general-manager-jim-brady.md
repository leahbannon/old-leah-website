I attended an event at American University where [TBD][1]&#8216;s General Manager Jim Brady provided some insight into the site and their unique approach to news, website usability, search engine optimization, etc. Most simply, TBD is the Washington DC area&#8217;s newest news venture. They have a very simple, eye-pleasing site and are getting a lot of attention lately for their partnership with local bloggers. I thought he made some great points:

- Usually, sites try keep you on only their site for as long as possible. No outgoing links! However, people are not on one page at a time, they&#8217;re on 15. **You won&#8217;t keep them on your site anyway, so why not provide more for visitors by hosting content from all over** &#8211; you can then develop loyalty as the one page to find everything. [This is pretty neat - I've spent a lot of time developing my RSS reader's DC section. Now you may not have to do that - they'll do it for you.]

- Similarly, TBD didn&#8217;t want to focus on how long people stay on the site [this is a very commonly used metric for success!] &#8211; they wanted to **answer your questions and interests quickly and easily** &#8211; they figure if you have a better user experience, you&#8217;ll keep coming back.

- **When you choose your locations to filter information, TBD uses real people** to organize and file that information &#8211; they figured that even though they could easily and cheaply have a program do that, it wouldn&#8217;t be long before you started to see articles about Arlington, TX and Vienna, Austria in your VA searches and then decided the site was a waste of your time.

- TBD wanted to ***start *with a mobile strategy and recognize mobile&#8217;s importance**, not just add it later.  They also aren&#8217;t just creating a mini-version of the site &#8211; its situational to provide you what you would want most on the go: weather, traffic, metro, etc. They really wanted to focus on how you live in your city. [Although, when I tried it on my Blackberry, that didn't work at all. Maybe you have to download the apps? I'm happy to blame my crapberry, but most of Washington is on one, so...]

- TBD knew they couldn&#8217;t cover everything with their 15 reporters, so they **picked a few subject areas to be really good at** &#8211; hopefully better than anyone else. Sports, traffic, music, film, etc. Yes, even though sports is already covered to death, they believe there is no &#8220;bottom of the bowl&#8221; for readers looking for information about sports &#8211; they&#8217;ll just keep reading and reading. [sigh...]

- TBD has **170 blogs in their blogger network** **and growing**. And they&#8217;re not just another tab or section &#8211; the bloggers are frequently featured prominently and important throughout the site.This is another example of where they&#8217;ll let you leave TBD for content.  [This both exciting and terrifying for me. Is this the new model? Bloggers as reporters for free? Scary...]

- They like to say that they use **Twitter as the new police scanner**. They&#8217;ve also tracked down people with good twitpics and asked them if they could post on the site, like for the Discovery incident.

- People tend to make fun of them occasionally for their very detailed titles, but it&#8217;s working for **search engine optimization** (SEO). They&#8217;ve been online for 6 weeks and **are beating the Washington Post in Google searches** for &#8220;washington dc news&#8221; and &#8220;dc news.&#8221; [Yikes!!! Post, you should be embarrassed! I know you could argue that the Post is a national news organization, but their Metro section is supposed to be pretty important...]

**So, what to do you think? Are you excited or mourning the death of journalism?**
