## About Me

I am a product lead at [18F](http://18f.gsa.gov), a new digital services startup within the federal government. I am also a co-captain of [Code for DC](http://codefordc.org), the DC chapter of the Code for America Brigades. We are a group of volunteer civic hackers working together to solve local issues and help people engage with the city. The project that I work on most at Code for DC these days is organizing the [Tech Lady Hackathon + Training Days](http://techladyhackathon.org).

"Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you, spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life." -Amy Poehler
