I want to broaden my circle of Facebook friends and maintain connections with colleagues, grad school classmates, family, etc. However, I also fear random photo tagging from parties and would like to share beach vacation pictures with close friends. I doubt I&#8217;m alone here&#8230;

There are plenty of posts that explain [how to create friend lists][1], but what about the best way to approach these lists and make them work for you? This is how I’ve decided to manage this for now; I’d love to hear your ideas and approaches, too.****

**1. Create a Close Friends List and a Professional Contacts List.** Your Close Friends List is for friends who you want to share all your pictures with and your Professional Contacts list is for friends you want to share the fewest, most benign pictures with. Everyone else can just fall in a grey area for now – you do not need to go through your whole Friend List, stressing about how to categorize everyone.****

**2. Only allow Close Friends to see photos you’ve been tagged in.** Go to your “Profile Information” settings page (Account > Privacy Settings > Profile Information). Under the setting “Photos and Videos of Me,” choose “Custom,” then “Specific People,” and then type your Close Friends List in the box (Facebook should auto-suggest the list once you start typing). Now, when people tag you in a photo, only that list of close friends can see it**.**

**3. Control which photos and albums Professional Contacts can see.** In the same “Profile Information” settings page, find the “Photo Albums” setting and click “Edit Settings.” Here, you can choose which albums you want to share with all your friends and which albums you want restrict your Professional Contacts List from seeing. For each album, click on the dropdown box next to the album, select “Custom,” then under “Make this visible to,” select “Only Friends,” and under “Hide this from,” type your Professional Contacts List.

You can apply this thinking to in a variety of different ways and to all the different options on the Profile Information settings page. This is just one part of my approach.
