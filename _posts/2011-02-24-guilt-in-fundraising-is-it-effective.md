According to the persuasion studies I&#8217;ve been reading lately (and am really sick of tonight), guilt is incredibly effective in persuasive messaging (and fundraising), as it can easily be elicited by others when they remind us that we are not meeting our values AND because we are very motivated to mitigate guilt as quickly as possible (Daniel J. O&#8217;Keefe, Guilt and Social Influence, 2000). However, when I think of persuasive fundraising, you know what does *not* come to mind? Those Catholic relief whatever ads with that old guy and pictures of sad kids, where I&#8217;m told repeatedly, &#8220;For just one dollar a day, you could easily save this little girl&#8217;s life. Why are you waiting?&#8221; For effective messaging, I think of these videos below, which evoke empathy and are moving, but do not make direct guilt appeals. What do you think? Also, please consider donating. :)
