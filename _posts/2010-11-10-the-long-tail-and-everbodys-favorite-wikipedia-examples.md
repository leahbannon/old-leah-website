**A New Economic Model**

Interestingly, the theory of the long tail, from Chris Anderson&#8217;s *The Long Tail: Why the Future is Selling Less of More*, is more of a new economic model than just a new way to describe trends in social media. Essentially, the long tail (the yellow part) is the right side of the model:

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-148" title="annotatedlongtail" src="http://leahbannon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/annotatedlongtail-300x215.jpg" alt="Annotated Long Tail" width="300" height="215" />][1]

On the left of the model, you have the head (the red part), which is composed of the big trends, hits, and blockbusters. There are very few of them, but they are so profitable, that’s where markets have focused until now. Much of this singular focus on the hits has been a result of the restrictions from the cost of providing more options &#8211; at some point, your profit starts to take a hit.

However, if you can lower the costs of providing something, for example, by providing a digital service, you have new potential. If you can take advantage of that new lower cost model by offering many, many more options to your customers while also helping them find what they want in this new plethora of choices, they will find their niche.

If you can offer enough consumers the niches they’re most interested in, when you add up all these niche purchases in the long tail, it begins to rival the hits. Anderson provides a lot of interesting examples in business today for this trend. For example, in books, the head represents all of the books that Barnes and Noble offers in their stores &#8211; about 100,000 of the most popular books. However, almost one third of all Amazon.com’s sales come from outside that top 100,000 &#8211; in the long tail. The same example holds true for the music choices that Walmart offers in their stores (the head) and the long tail that iTunes and Rhapsody offer in their online catalogs. And of course, don&#8217;t forget Wikipedia…

**Everybody Loves a Wikipedia Example**

For encyclopedias, Britannica covers the top 120,000 most popular subjects – the head in the model – and they cover it well and thoroughly. However, not only does Wikipedia cover those, it also covers millions more &#8211; the long tail. Niche interests are fulfilled and the world gets a more comprehensive encyclopedia. For free.

In *Tribes*, Seth Godin uses a Wikipedia example to describe Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia’s founder, as a leader, not a manager. He aruges that Wales built a successful tribe around Wikipedia by attacting a small group of dedicated contributors by engaging them in a vision while also giving them the freedom to execute. He then connected his tribe through wiki technology.

In *Here Comes Everybody*, as I discussed last week, Clay Shirky uses Wikipedia as an example of how the internet broke Coase’s rule that some large and very important tasks will never be accomplished because they are too expensive for large companies to manage and too large for small companies to attempt. The internet enables massive tasks to be accomplished with little management and organization. While Wikipedia requires many, many eyes to continue to be accurate, it succeeds largely because of its lack of top-down management.

Li and Bernoff also used Wikipedia as an example in *Groundswell*. They stated that while many activities in the groundswell are uncoordinated, Wikipedia’s groundswell has managed to coordinate itself. Wikipedia demonstrates what incredible things can be accomplished when the groundswell comes together and collaborates. The community not only creates, but stays to monitor, improve, and heal.

Personally, my favorite Wikipedia example comes from Jonathon Zittrain. I think he provides more of the valuable context to Wikipedia and why it is successful &#8211; and why it’s also a crazy, stupid idea! I suggest you check out the whole thing (especially since you&#8217;ll get the jokes better), but if you want to skip to the Wikipedia part, it starts around minute 9. Enjoy:
