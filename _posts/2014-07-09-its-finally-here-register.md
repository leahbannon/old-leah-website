### Hi there.

It's finally here! Go [register for the Tech Lady Hackathon + Training Day](http://techladyhackathon2.eventbrite.com), July 26 at Google. Anyone who identifies as a woman is welcome, no other prerequisite or skills needed. I promise.&nbsp;Also, the [pre-party on Friday night at MapBox](http://techladyjuly.splashthat.com/) is open to people of all genders who support tech ladies.

We will have some awesome training, workshops, and mentoring sessions&mdash;in addition to the hackathon projects&mdash;but this time, we also have a special Lean In DC panel. It is about succeeding as a woman in tech and it starts at 4pm.

[Check out my blog post if you want to&nbsp;learn more](http://leah.io/2014/01/that-techlady-hackathon-we-organized-was-awesome-so-whats-next/) about the first Tech Lady Hackathon + Training Day.

### What else is going on?

Are you going to&nbsp;[YXYY](http://www.yesandyesyes.com/#say-yes)? Me too! 1. Let's&nbsp;meet. 2. Are you driving from LA? I need a ride. Srsly.&nbsp;I'm flying in tomorrow, so I can leave LA after 5:30pm tomorrow or any time Friday.

Helen Tran's short piece in Medium about working in tech and ambition, [This Is Water](https://medium.com/@tranhelen/this-is-water-2ba9dbbe7e28), is so well written it verged on poetry. READ IT. I attended&nbsp;the first [White House LGBTQ Innovation Summit](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23whitehouselgbt&src=typd) on Monday and it was inspiring. Thanks, Leanne and [Queer Women Who Tech](http://lesbianswhotech.org/). Interested in doing something awesome in civic tech?
