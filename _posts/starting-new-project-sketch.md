1. Start with a community project that's working on a cause you believe in. Find someone who works there and who you can work with.
1. Find a project that needs a technical solution.
1. Find a time you can meet to do a user-centered design sketch. Do basic 3-hour user-centered design session (probably at a brigade meetup) that includes community partners and users. (Work with community partner to get important attendees there). [guidelines for conducting that design session coming soon]
1. Develop list of user stories that will get you to a basic, initial prototype of what you designed in session (above). Make it a super basic minimum viable product! (So basic that it just needs to be the absolute minimum required to build something that users can test.)
1. Use scrum process to plan sprints to finish that prototype. The sprints might be really long (1 month) in a volunteer brigade group.
1. Work with community partner to set up a round of ux testing.
1. Repeat last 3 steps. Demo to brigade (so we can cheer for your work). Inivite community partners and any other stakeholders (possibly in government).
1. Repeat last 4 steps as needed until you no longer want to/need sustain the product.
