This is big news, so I thought a quick run down of the basics might be nice before the real fun starts when I summarize the interesting bits of what’s been said.

**January 12:** Google announces in a blog post that they recently discovered a “highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China.” They said that they believe the attacks were targeted against the email accounts of Chinese human rights activists and that Google was only one of over 20 companies targeted. Importantly, Google hinted but did not state that the Chinese government was involved. Also, importantly, while Google proprietary information was accessed via security weaknesses, the Gmail accounts were accessed via phishing and viruses (read: you clicked on something dumb). Most importantly, Google announced that because of this and China’s increasing censorship over the past year, they will stop self-censoring results on Google.cn and that “this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.”

**March 22:** In another blog post, Google announces that early that day, they stopped self-censoring search results on Google.cn by forwarding visitors over to their Hong Kong site, Google.com.hk, which provides uncensored results in simplified Chinese. They warn this might not go well, because “the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self-censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement.”

**March 22:** China sensors Google search results and content and Chinese newspapers accuse Google of collaborating with US spies. Additionally, Google’s Chinese partnerships, like those with China Unicom and China Mobile begin to unravel, and according to [ NYTimes][1], “Technology analysts and the business executives said Google might also face problems in keeping its advertising sales force, which is crucial to the success of its Chinese language service on PCs and mobile phones.”
